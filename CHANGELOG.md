# Changelog

This document lists new features, improvements, changes, and bug fixes in every GDScript docs maker release.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.6.0

### New Features

- If a GDScript file does not use class_name, the name of that file is now used as the class name to include previously not documented files

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.5.1

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `make build` setuptools build by using `src` layout
- Fixed `pip install` installation workflow (tested locally, PyPi package needs to be updated) - Related issue: [#76](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker/issues/76)
- Fixed `generate_reference` not finding any file when using -d option (may fix [issue #63](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker/issues/63))

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.5.0

### New Features

- Added support for constants by @db0.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed descriptions eating whitespace and flattening nested lists. By @db0.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.4.0

### New Features

- Added support for inner classes.
  - _Known limitation: the program only supports one nesting level at the moment. This is in part
    because by writing them recursively, we would not have enough heading levels (web pages support
    6, we are already using 5). Also, we haven't found a project that used that GDScript feature
    yet, nesting sub-classes._
- The shell program `get_reference` now supports command line flags.
- You can specify directories of the Godot project to parse with `get_reference` and the
  `-d/--directory` option.

### Improvements

- There is now a `-V/--version` flag to print the version number.
- Improved the shell program `get_reference`'s code to better report errors and work by calling
  `./get_reference`
- Setter and getter functions now render as a bullet-point list with the member variable they belong to.

### Changes

- Headings now generate only with leading hashes `#` instead of being wrapped in hashes.
- The syntax for tags and other special information now is like JSDoc: `@tags - tag1, tag2, tag3`.
  This differentiates special markup or metadata from the regular docstring. There is also a
  discussion to [adopt markup like this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/177)
  in Godot.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an error when using the `--format hugo` option.
- Added the relative "../" to links to Fixed links leading to 404 pages.
- Fixed table for setters and getters rendering as plain text with some markdown parsers.
- Fixed function call error in `ReferenceCollector.gd`.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.3.0

### Features

- Create an **index page** with a table of contents. To do so, use the new
  command-line option `--make-index`. This generates an extra `index.md` file.
- You can now **link between classes**, including to specific methods and
  properties:
  - Write `[ClassName]`, `[ClassName.symbol]`, or `[symbol_in_this_class]` and
    docs maker will replace it with a link to the corresponding page and
    heading.
- Add support for the **class category**`metadata: this allows you to group classes by categories. Add a line with`# category: My Category` in your
  class's docstring to register a category for it.
- Classes now show all ancestors they extend, and the extends list links to
  the reference of parent classes.
- Store and write key project information: name, description, and human-readable
  version string.
  - We get them from the Application Settings in your Godot project.
  - For the project version, in 3.2.0, you need to add it yourself as
    `application/config/version. It must be with the form "1.0.0". Future or
    more recent Godot versions should have this defined by default. Upon
    exporting your game, Godot should also use this version number.

### Improvements

- The Windows `generate_reference.bat` command-line script now supports
  command-line flags and arguments. The script also now checks for and prevents
  common errors.
- Remove `extends` line if the class doesn't extend any type.
- Remove properties summary and methods summary if the class respectively
  doesn't have public properties or methods.

### Changes

- Changed the default export directory to "export", as we use "dist" to build
  the program's pip package itself.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.2.1

### Changes

- Move the pip package's configuration to `setup.cfg`.
  - The setup now automatically finds packages and data.
  - This improves type checks and imports with mypy.

### Bug fixes

- The tool now outputs regular markdown code blocks instead of hugo shortcodes by default.
- The `Collector.gd` script you can run from Godot's editor now rebuilds the language server cache so you don't need to restart Godot to rebuild the JSON class data.
- Fixed an error in markdown conversion when the Godot Language Server generates empty classes in the generated JSON file.
  - If a class doesn't have a name, docs maker will now skip it.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.2

_In development_

### Features

- Add code highlighting to the `hugo` output format.
- Add `--date` and `--author` command line flags for the hugo front matter output.
- Add support for the `abstract` tag, for abstract base classes.
- Add GDScript code highlighting for the hugo export format.
- Add support for enums.

### Improvements

- The documents now only have 1 empty line betweens paragraphs, headings, etc. instead of 2 to 4.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.1

### Features

- New output format for the static website engine [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with toml front-matter. Use the `--format hugo` option to select it.
- New `--dry-run` command-line option to output debug information.

### Bug fixes

- Use code blocks for functions instead of inline code.

## GDScript Docs Maker 1.0

This is the initial release of the program. It can collect and generate a code reference from your Godot GDScript projects.

### Features

- Parses and collects docstrings from GDScript files, using Godot 3.2's Language Server. Outputs the data as JSON.
- Converts the JSON data to markdown files.
  - Writes methods, static functions, signals, member variables, and class data.
  - Only writes relevant sections. For example, the tool only creates a "Method Descriptions" section if there are methods in the class.
  - Skips built-in callbacks, i.e. `_process`, `_input`, etc.
  - Skips the constructor, `_init`, unless it has arguments.
  - Skips private functions and member variables, unless tagged as virtual.
- Supports tags in the source code with the `tags:` keyword followed by comma-separated strings, like `tags: virtual, deprecated`.
  - Currently, the program only takes `virtual` into account, but it does store all the tags.
- There are two shell scripts for POSIX shells (sh, bash, etc.) and Windows CMD, respectively. Use them to generate your code reference instantly.
